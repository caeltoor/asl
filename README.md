# Autosplitters

## About

This repo is created to hold autosplitters for the Legacy of Kain series, though others may be added.

These autosplitters are for livesplit.

## Legacy of Kain: Defiance Autosplitter

Autosplitting, start, and reset available. Original code by [blastedt](https://github.com/blastedt) and memory addresses found by TheDuriel. 

The timer starts when you begin moving in the first level. It splits when you first enter certain maps.

## Other splitters

Eventually other Legacy of Kain autosplitters will be added eventually.
